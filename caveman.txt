Me have big JSON. Me want React code that use big JSON for question flow. Ugh!

Me show JSON here:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "questionnaire_version": "1.0.0",
  "upload_photo": true,
  "start": "category_topics",
  "end": {
    "heading": "Because of you, a child...",
    "body_photo_only": "(html) your photo will be sent...",
    "body_photo_and_questionnaire": "(html) your photo and questionnaire will be sent...",
    "body_skipped": "thanks for nothing!"
  },
  "category_topics": {
    "type": "topic",
    "cta": "Continue",
    "options": [
      {
        "key": "family",
        "title": "Family",
        "image": "http://...jpg",
        "go_to_key": "family_question"
      },
      {
        "key": "pets",
        "title": "Pets",
        "image": "http://...jpg",
        "go_to_key": "pets_question"
      }
    ]
  },
  "family_question": {
    "type": "textarea",
    "title": "What is your favorite way to spend time with your family?",
    "title_for_child": "Here's what your sponsor says about family: ",
    "cta": "Submit",
    "go_to_key": "end"
  },
  "pets_question": {
    "type": "textarea",
    "title": "What role do pets play in your life?",
    "title_for_child": "Here's what your sponsor says about pets: ",
    "cta": "Submit",
    "go_to_key": "end"
  }
}
Grunt Work App Must Do:
Check questionnaire_version
Me want app to look at "questionnaire_version". If version "1.0.0", keep going. If not, show error or do fallback. Ugh.

Photo Upload

JSON say "upload_photo" is true. Must do photo step first.
Me no care if real or fake. Just have big button that say "Upload Photo" or "Me pick photo."
Start Node

JSON say "start": "category_topics". This be first question.
Then show next questions by reading "go_to_key".
Also have skip button: skip go to "end" instantly. Ugh.
Question Types

"topic" type: show many options in grid. Each option have key, title, image. When user click, go next question from "go_to_key".
"textarea" type: user put text in box. Then user click CTA to go next question or end.
End Node

When app reach "end", show text from end.heading. Then also show one of these:
end.body_photo_only
end.body_photo_and_questionnaire
end.body_skipped
Me want to collect user answers from any "textarea" question. Save them in object like { "family_question": "User typed..." }.
If user skip all, show body_skipped. If user do photo but no question, maybe show body_photo_only. If user do everything, show body_photo_and_questionnaire.
Acceptance

Code read big JSON from widgetConfig.
Code show photo upload.
Code follow start key to show first question. Then next question. Then end. Ugh.
Code do skip right to end.
Must handle "topic" question type. Must handle "textarea" question type.
End screen appear. Show lines from JSON.
Me Want Code
Me want React code that do all steps:

Use function or class. Function good.
Keep style simple, or no style.
Show how app store answers (maybe in useState).
Show skip button.
Show end screen text.
Me want short explanation after code. Then me happy.

Grunt job done. Provide code! Ugh!
